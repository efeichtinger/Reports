It's been two weeks since Gordon and I last met because I came down with a cold that lasted a week and to top it off, I got the worst migraine in recent memory last Friday that put me in bed all afternoon. Anyway, here is a summary from when we last left off on February 2, 2016. 

My last report included some figures with r (intrinsic rate of growth) as a function of T and R0. Gordon had some suggestions on how to improve the figures so we are seeing real patterns and not artifacts in the graphs.  

## Changes suggested 
* Remove points where r = 0 (R0 = 1)
* Rescale axes
* Change dimensions
* Change symbol type
* Adjust color bar so it is the same length for T and R0
* Increase sampling intensity in g if needed, see how new symbols look
