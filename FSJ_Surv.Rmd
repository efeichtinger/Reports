The last report I made on this research project was on January 25, 2016. I estimated survival over time using the Kaplan-Meir estimate. I constructed a survival curve for all known-age birds in the population from fledge date to date last seen. Then, I made a survival curve for breeders in the population. 

I realize my error on the procedure for determining if first time breeders have a different survival probability than experienced breeders. I am using years of experience as a covariate in the models. The input data will have multiple rows per individual jay (if the bird bred more than once), the date first recorded as a breeder and date last seen or still alive and some other information about each bird. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#read in CSV of all birds 
birds <- read.csv("Erin_Surv_All.csv")
str(birds)

#remove duplicates 
birds2 <- birds[!duplicated(birds),]
str(birds2)
#2322 observations of 6 variables - known age birds only, so birds that were
#hatched on the study tract (fledge date knowm), from Jan 1981 to Dec 2015 

colnames(birds2)[7] <- "LastObsDate"


#convert dates to date format
birds2$FldgDate <- as.Date(birds2$FldgDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
birds2$LastObsDate <- as.Date(birds2$LastObsDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

#subtract dates to get number of days
date.diff<- birds2$LastObsDate-birds2$FldgDate

#add to data frame - survival period in days
birds2["days"] <- date.diff
birds2$days <-as.numeric(birds2$days)
#and survival period in years 
birds2["yrs"] <- birds2$days/365.25

#very important piece of code for the model to work properly 
birds2 <- subset(birds2, birds2$days > 0)

#add column for censorship status 
birds2["censorship"] <- 1
#If last observed date = 10/14/2015, 0 for still alive today
birds2$censorship[which(birds2$LastObsDate=="2015-10-14")]<-0


year <- as.POSIXlt(birds2$FldgDate)$year+1900
birds2["FYear"] <- year
#change back to numeric for survival object 
birds2$FldgDate <- as.numeric(birds2$FldgDate)
birds2$LastObsDate <- as.numeric(birds2$LastObsDate)
birds2$days <- as.numeric(birds2$days)
birds2$yrs <- as.numeric(birds2$yrs)


#Create survival object based off Gordon's Cactus Finch example
